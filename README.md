🐌 SnailShare - Because Sharing at a Snail's Pace is Still Sharing!
Repository for SnailShare: The file-sharing platform that's so user-friendly, even gastropods can use it!
Description
SnailShare: Where your files move slow but your productivity grows! This TypeScript-powered application delivers your data at a shell-shocking pace. We may not be the fastest, but we carry everything you need on our backs!
🐌 Slow and steady wins the race - Our Express-based server architecture ensures your files arrive exactly when they mean to, not a moment sooner!
🐚 Shell-ter your important files - With our secure middleware, your data is protected like a snail in its shell!
🍃 Leave a trail - Comprehensive logging keeps track of every slime-lined path your files take through our system!
Why SnailShare?
Because in a world of hares rushing to share their files, sometimes you need a gastropod's perspective. After all, what's the hurry? Good things come to those who wait... and wait... and wait...
Remember: Life's a garden, dig it—just watch out for the snails using our app!
